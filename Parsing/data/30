While there are a lot of pieces that go into a college application, <strong>you should focus on only a few critical things:</strong></p> \n   <ul> \n    <li><strong>GPA requirements</strong></li> \n    <li>Testing requirements, including <strong>SAT and ACT requirements</strong></li> \n    <li><strong>Application requirements</strong></li> \n   </ul> \n   <p>In this guide we'll cover what you need to get into Tufts and build a strong application.</p> \n   <p>School location: Medford, MA</p> \n   <p>This school is also known as: Tufts University</p>   \n   <br>   \n   <span></span>\n   <h2>Admissions Rate: 16%</h2>  \n   <p>If you want to get in, the first thing to look at is the acceptance rate. This tells you how competitive the school is and how serious their requirements are.</p> \n   <p><strong>The acceptance rate at Tufts is 16%</strong>. For every 100 applicants, only 16 are admitted.</p>  \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-5.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>This means the school is <strong>extremely selective</strong>. Meeting their GPA requirements and SAT/ACT requirements is very important to getting past their first round of filters and proving your academic preparation. If you don't meet their expectations, your chance of getting is nearly zero.</p>\n   <p>After crossing this hurdle, you'll need to impress Tufts application readers through their other application requirements, including extracurriculars, essays, and letters of recommendation.

For this, we look at the school's average GPA for its current students.</p>  \n   <span></span>\n   <h2>Average GPA: 4.05</h2>  \n   <p>The <strong>average GPA</strong> at Tufts is <strong>4.05</strong>.</p> \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-6.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>(Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA. This school did not officially report its average GPA, but we've estimated it here using data from over 1,000 schools.) </p> \n   <p>With a GPA of 4.05, <strong>Tufts requires you to be at the top of your class</strong>. You'll need nearly straight A's in all your classes to compete with other applicants. Furthermore, you should be taking hard classes - AP or IB courses - to show that college-level academics is a breeze. </p> \n   <p> If you're currently a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change in time for college applications. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 4.05, <strong>you'll need a higher SAT or ACT score to compensate</strong>. This will help you compete effectively against other applicants who have higher GPAs than you. </p> \n   <br> \n   <h3>SAT and ACT Requirements</h3> \n   <div> \n    <p>Each school has different requirements for standardized testing. Most schools require the SAT or ACT, and many also require SAT subject tests.</p> \n    <p> <strong>You must take either the SAT or ACT to submit an application to Tufts.</strong> More importantly, you need to do well to have a strong application. </p>\n    <h3>Tufts SAT Requirements</h3> \n    <p>Many schools say they have no SAT score cutoff, but the truth is that there is a hidden SAT requirement. This is based on the school's average score.</p>  \n    <span></span>\n    <h2>Average SAT: 1490 (Old: 2149)</h2>  \n    <p>The <strong>average SAT score</strong> composite at Tufts is a <strong>1490</strong> on the 1600 SAT scale.</p> \n    <p>On the <strong>old 2400 SAT</strong>, this corresponds to an <strong>average SAT score of 2149</strong>.</p> \n    <p>This score makes Tufts <strong>Strongly Competitive</strong> for SAT test scores.</p> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-5.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <br> \n    <h4>Tufts SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)</h4> \n    <p>The 25th percentile New SAT score is 1440, and the 75th percentile New SAT score is 1550.

In other words, a <strong>2050 on the Old SAT places you below average, while a 2290 puts you well above average</strong>.</p> \n    <p>Here's the breakdown of old SAT scores by section:</p> \n    <table> \n     <thead> \n      <tr>\n       <td><strong>Section</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>Average</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>25th Percentile</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>75th Percentile</strong></td>\n      </tr> \n     </thead> \n     <tbody> \n      <tr>\n       <td><strong>Math</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>723</strong></td>\n       <td>690</td>\n       <td>770</td>\n      </tr> \n      <tr>\n       <td><strong>Reading</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>713</strong></td>\n       <td>680</td>\n       <td>750</td>\n      </tr> \n      <tr>\n       <td><strong>Writing</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>713</strong></td>\n       <td>680</td>\n       <td>770</td>\n      </tr> \n      <tr>\n       <td><strong>Composite</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>2149</strong></td>\n       <td>2050</td>\n       <td>2290</td>\n      </tr> \n     </tbody> \n    </table> \n    <h3>SAT Score Choice Policy</h3> \n    <p>The Score Choice policy at your school is an important part of your testing strategy.</p> \n    <p>Tufts has the Score Choice policy of <strong>\"All Scores.\"</strong></p> \n    <p>This means that Tufts requires you to send all SAT scores you've ever taken to their office.</p> \n    <p>This sounds daunting, but most schools don't actually consider all your scores equally. For example, if you scored an 1300 on one test and a 1500 on another, they won't actually average the two tests.</p> \n    <p>More commonly, the school will take your highest score on a single test date. Even better, some schools form a Superscore - that is, they take your highest section score across all your test dates and combine them.</p> \n    <p>Some students are still worried about submitting too many test scores. They're afraid that Tufts will look down on too many attempts to raise your score. But how many is too many?</p> \n    <p>From our research and talking to admissions officers, we've learned that <strong>4-6 tests is a safe number to submit</strong>. The college understands that you want to have the best chance of admission, and retaking the test is a good way to do this. Within a reasonable number of tests, they honestly don't care how many times you've taken it. They'll just focus on your score.</p> \n    <p>If you take it more than 6 times, colleges start wondering why you're not improving with each test. They'll question your study skills and ability to improve.</p> \n    <p>But below 6 tests, we strongly encourage retaking the test to maximize your chances. If your SAT score is currently below a 1550, <strong>we strongly recommend that you consider prepping for the SAT and retaking it</strong>. You don't have much to lose, and you can potentially raise your score and significantly boost your chances of getting in.</p> \n    <br> \n    <div> \n     <strong>Exclusive: Want to learn how to improve your SAT score by 160 points?</strong> \n     <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/guide-sat.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n     <div> \n      <p><a href=\"https://www.prepscholar.com/sat/l/tour_sat_guide\">Download our free guide</a> on the top 5 strategies you must be using to improve your score.

This score makes Tufts <strong>Strongly Competitive</strong> for ACT scores.</p> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-5.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <p>The 25th percentile ACT score is 30, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 33. </p> \n    <p>Even though Tufts likely says they have no minimum ACT requirement, if you apply with a 30 or below, you'll have a very hard time getting in, unless you have something else very impressive in your application. There are so many applicants scoring 32 and above that a 30 will look academically weak.</p> \n    <h4>ACT Score Sending Policy</h4> \n    <p>If you're taking the ACT as opposed to the SAT, you have a huge advantage in how you send scores, and this dramatically affects your testing strategy.</p> \n    <p>Here it is: <strong>when you send ACT scores to colleges, you have absolute control over which tests you send.</strong> You could take 10 tests, and only send your highest one. This is unlike the SAT, where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken.</p> \n    <p>This means that you have more chances than you think to improve your ACT score. To try to aim for the school's ACT requirement of 33 and above, you should try to take the ACT as many times as you can. When you have the final score that you're happy with, you can then send only that score to all your schools.</p> \n    <h4>ACT Superscore Policy</h4> \n    <p>By and large, most colleges do not superscore the ACT. (Superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit, and then combines them into the best possible composite score). Thus, most schools will just take your highest ACT score from a single sitting.</p> \n    <p>However, in our research, we found that <strong>Tufts does in fact offer an ACT superscore policy</strong>. To quote their Admissions Office:</p> \n    <p>When taken multiple times, we will use your highest sub-score for each section.</p> \n    <p><a href=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/sat/s/colleges/Tufts-admission-requirements\">Source</a></p> \n    <p>Superscoring is powerful to your testing strategy, and you need to make sure you plan your testing accordingly. Of all the scores that Tufts receives, your application readers will consider your <strong>highest section scores across all ACT test dates you submit</strong>.</p> \n    <p>Click below to learn more about how superscoring critically affects your test strategy.</p> \n    <div> \n     <a href=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/sat/s/colleges/Tufts-admission-requirements#\">How does superscoring change your test strategy? <span>(Click to Learn)</span></a> \n     <div> \n      <p>For example, say you submit the following 4 test scores:</p> \n      <table> \n       <tbody>\n        <tr> \n         <th> </th> \n         <th>English</th> \n         <th>Math</th> \n         <th>Reading</th> \n         <th>Science</th> \n         <th>Composite</th> \n        </tr> \n        <tr> \n         <td>Test 1</td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>20</td> \n        </tr> \n        <tr> \n         <td>Test 2</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>20</td> \n        </tr> \n        <tr> \n         <td>Test 3</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>20</td> \n        </tr> \n        <tr> \n         <td>Test 4</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td>20</td> \n        </tr> \n        <tr> \n         <td><strong>Superscore</strong></td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n        </tr> \n       </tbody>\n      </table> \n      <p>Even though the highest ACT composite you scored on any one test date was 20, Tufts will take your highest section score from all your test dates, then combine them to form your Superscore. <strong>You can raise your composite score from 20 to 32 in this example.</strong></p> \n      <p>This is important for your testing strategy. Because you can choose which tests to send in, and Tufts forms your Superscore, <strong>you can take the ACT as many times as you want, then submit only the tests that give you the highest Superscore.</strong> Your application readers will only see that one score.</p> \n     </div> \n    </div> \n    <p>Therefore, if your ACT score is currently below a 33, <strong>we strongly recommend that you consider prepping for the ACT and retaking it</strong>. You have a very good chance of raising your score, which will significantly boost your chances of getting in.</p> \n    <p>Even better, because of the Superscore, you can focus all your energy on a single section at a time. If your Reading score is lower than your other sections, prep only for the Reading section, then take the ACT. Then focus on Math for the next test, and so on. This will surely give you the highest Superscore possible.</p> \n    <br> \n    <div> \n     <strong>Studying for the ACT instead?

They'll use this as another factor in their admissions consideration.</p> \n    <br> \n    <h3>SAT Subject Test Requirements</h3> \n    <p>Schools vary in their SAT subject test requirements. Typically, selective schools tend to require them, while most schools in the country do not.</p> \n    <p>Tufts <strong>requires SAT Subject Tests if you're submitting an SAT score, not an ACT score</strong>. If you submit an ACT score with Writing, you do not need SAT subject tests.</p> \n    <p>Typically, your SAT/ACT and GPA are far more heavily weighed than your SAT Subject Tests. If you have the choice between improving your SAT/ACT score or your SAT Subject Test scores, <strong>definitely choose to improve your SAT/ACT score</strong>.</p> \n    <br> \n   </div> \n   <br>    \n   <span></span>\n   <h2>Final Admissions Verdict</h2>  \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-5.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>Because this school is <strong>extremely selective, getting a high SAT/ACT score and GPA is vital to having a chance at getting in</strong>. If you don't pass their SAT/ACT and GPA requirements, they'll likely reject you without much consideration.</p> \n   <p><strong>To have the best shot of getting in, you should aim for the 75th percentile, with a 2290 SAT or a 33 ACT</strong>. You should also have a 4.05 GPA or higher. If your GPA is lower than this, you need to compensate with a higher SAT/ACT score.</p> \n   <p>For a school as selective as Tufts, you'll also need to impress them with the rest of your application. We'll cover those details next.</p> \n   <p>But if you apply with a score below a 2290 SAT or a 33 ACT, you unfortunately start out with the odds against you and have a tiny chance of getting in. There are just too many students with high SAT/ACT scores and strong applications, and you need to compete against them.</p>     \n   <br> \n   <div> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/adm_cta_img.jpg\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <br> \n    <strong>Want to build the best possible college application?</strong> \n    <div> \n     <p> We can help. <a href=\"https://admissions.prepscholar.com/\"><strong>PrepScholar Admissions</strong></a> is the world's best admissions consulting service.
