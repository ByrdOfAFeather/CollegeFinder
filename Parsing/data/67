For this, we look at the school's average GPA for its current students.</p>  \n   <span></span>\n   <h2>Average GPA: 3.71</h2>  \n   <p>The <strong>average GPA</strong> at University of Denver is <strong>3.71</strong>.</p> \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-5.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>(Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA. </p> \n   <p>With a GPA of 3.71, <strong>University of Denver requires you to be above average</strong> in your high school class. You'll need at least a mix of A's and B's, with more A's than B's. You can compensate for a lower GPA with harder classes, like AP or IB classes. This will show that you're able to handle more difficult academics than the average high school student. </p> \n   <p> If you're currently a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change in time for college applications. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 3.71, <strong>you'll need a higher SAT or ACT score to compensate</strong>. This will help you compete effectively against other applicants who have higher GPAs than you. </p> \n   <br> \n   <h3>SAT and ACT Requirements</h3> \n   <div> \n    <p>Each school has different requirements for standardized testing. Most schools require the SAT or ACT, and many also require SAT subject tests.</p> \n    <p> <strong>You must take either the SAT or ACT to submit an application to University of Denver.</strong> More importantly, you need to do well to have a strong application. </p>\n    <h3>University of Denver SAT Requirements</h3> \n    <p>Many schools say they have no SAT score cutoff, but the truth is that there is a hidden SAT requirement. This is based on the school's average score.</p>  \n    <span></span>\n    <h2>Average SAT: 1290 (Old: 1801)</h2>  \n    <p>The <strong>average SAT score</strong> composite at University of Denver is a <strong>1290</strong> on the 1600 SAT scale.</p> \n    <p>On the <strong>old 2400 SAT</strong>, this corresponds to an <strong>average SAT score of 1801</strong>.</p> \n    <p>This score makes University of Denver <strong>Moderately Competitive</strong> for SAT test scores.</p> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-4.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <br> \n    <h4>University of Denver SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)</h4> \n    <p>The 25th percentile New SAT score is 1180, and the 75th percentile New SAT score is 1380.

This score makes University of Denver <strong>Moderately Competitive</strong> for ACT scores.</p> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-4.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <p>The 25th percentile ACT score is 23, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 30. </p> \n    <p>Even though University of Denver likely says they have no minimum ACT requirement, if you apply with a 23 or below, you'll have a harder time getting in, unless you have something else impressive in your application.</p> \n    <h4>ACT Score Sending Policy</h4> \n    <p>If you're taking the ACT as opposed to the SAT, you have a huge advantage in how you send scores, and this dramatically affects your testing strategy.</p> \n    <p>Here it is: <strong>when you send ACT scores to colleges, you have absolute control over which tests you send.</strong> You could take 10 tests, and only send your highest one. This is unlike the SAT, where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken.</p> \n    <p>This means that you have more chances than you think to improve your ACT score. To try to aim for the school's ACT requirement of 23 and above, you should try to take the ACT as many times as you can. When you have the final score that you're happy with, you can then send only that score to all your schools.</p> \n    <h4>ACT Superscore Policy</h4> \n    <p>By and large, most colleges do not superscore the ACT. (Superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit, and then combines them into the best possible composite score). Thus, most schools will just take your highest ACT score from a single sitting.</p> \n    <p>However, in our research, we found that <strong>University of Denver does in fact offer an ACT superscore policy</strong>. To quote their Admissions Office:</p> \n    <p>For students who submit results from multiple test dates, we will mix and match the individual section scores to create a composite \"superscore.\" When assessing your test scores, we will use the highest composite \"superscore\" earned on either exam (ACT or SAT).</p> \n    <p><a href=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/sat/s/colleges/University-of-Denver-admission-requirements\">Source</a></p> \n    <p>Superscoring is powerful to your testing strategy, and you need to make sure you plan your testing accordingly. Of all the scores that University of Denver receives, your application readers will consider your <strong>highest section scores across all ACT test dates you submit</strong>.</p> \n    <p>Click below to learn more about how superscoring critically affects your test strategy.</p> \n    <div> \n     <a href=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/sat/s/colleges/University-of-Denver-admission-requirements#\">How does superscoring change your test strategy? <span>(Click to Learn)</span></a> \n     <div> \n      <p>For example, say you submit the following 4 test scores:</p> \n      <table> \n       <tbody>\n        <tr> \n         <th> </th> \n         <th>English</th> \n         <th>Math</th> \n         <th>Reading</th> \n         <th>Science</th> \n         <th>Composite</th> \n        </tr> \n        <tr> \n         <td>Test 1</td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>20</td> \n        </tr> \n        <tr> \n         <td>Test 2</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>20</td> \n        </tr> \n        <tr> \n         <td>Test 3</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>20</td> \n        </tr> \n        <tr> \n         <td>Test 4</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td>20</td> \n        </tr> \n        <tr> \n         <td><strong>Superscore</strong></td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n        </tr> \n       </tbody>\n      </table> \n      <p>Even though the highest ACT composite you scored on any one test date was 20, University of Denver will take your highest section score from all your test dates, then combine them to form your Superscore. <strong>You can raise your composite score from 20 to 32 in this example.</strong></p> \n      <p>This is important for your testing strategy. Because you can choose which tests to send in, and University of Denver forms your Superscore, <strong>you can take the ACT as many times as you want, then submit only the tests that give you the highest Superscore.</strong> Your application readers will only see that one score.</p> \n     </div> \n    </div> \n    <p>Therefore, if your ACT score is currently below a 23, <strong>we strongly recommend that you consider prepping for the ACT and retaking it</strong>. You have a very good chance of raising your score, which will significantly boost your chances of getting in.</p> \n    <p>Even better, because of the Superscore, you can focus all your energy on a single section at a time. If your Reading score is lower than your other sections, prep only for the Reading section, then take the ACT. Then focus on Math for the next test, and so on. This will surely give you the highest Superscore possible.</p> \n    <br> \n    <div> \n     <strong>Studying for the ACT instead?

Typically, selective schools tend to require them, while most schools in the country do not.</p> \n    <p>We did not find information that University of Denver requires SAT subject tests, and so <strong>most likely it does not</strong>.
