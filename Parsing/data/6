While there are a lot of pieces that go into a college application, <strong>you should focus on only a few critical things:</strong></p> \n   <ul> \n    <li><strong>GPA requirements</strong></li> \n    <li>Testing requirements, including <strong>SAT and ACT requirements</strong></li> \n    <li><strong>Application requirements</strong></li> \n   </ul> \n   <p>In this guide we'll cover what you need to get into UT Austin and build a strong application.</p> \n   <p>School location: Austin, TX</p> \n   <p>This school is also known as: University of Texas at Austin</p>   \n   <br>   \n   <span></span>\n   <h2>Admissions Rate: 40%</h2>  \n   <p>If you want to get in, the first thing to look at is the acceptance rate. This tells you how competitive the school is and how serious their requirements are.</p> \n   <p><strong>The acceptance rate at UT Austin is 40%</strong>. For every 100 applicants, 40 are admitted.</p>  \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-4.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>This means the school is <strong>moderately selective</strong>. The school expects you to meet their requirements for GPA and SAT/ACT scores, but they're more flexible than other schools. If you exceed their requirements, you have an excellent chance of getting in. But if you don't, you might be one of the unlucky minority that gets a rejection letter. </p> \n   <br> \n   <div> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/adm_cta_img.jpg\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <br> \n    <strong>Want to build the best possible college application?</strong> \n    <div> \n     <p> We can help. <a href=\"https://admissions.prepscholar.com/\"><strong>PrepScholar Admissions</strong></a> is the world's best admissions consulting service.

For this, we look at the school's average GPA for its current students.</p>  \n   <span></span>\n   <h2>Average GPA: 3.75</h2>  \n   <p>The <strong>average GPA</strong> at UT Austin is <strong>3.75</strong>.</p> \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-5.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>(Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA. This school did not officially report its average GPA, but we've estimated it here using data from over 1,000 schools.) </p> \n   <p>With a GPA of 3.75, <strong>UT Austin requires you to be above average</strong> in your high school class. You'll need at least a mix of A's and B's, with more A's than B's. You can compensate for a lower GPA with harder classes, like AP or IB classes. This will show that you're able to handle more difficult academics than the average high school student. </p> \n   <p> If you're currently a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change in time for college applications. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 3.75, <strong>you'll need a higher SAT or ACT score to compensate</strong>. This will help you compete effectively against other applicants who have higher GPAs than you. </p> \n   <br> \n   <h3>SAT and ACT Requirements</h3> \n   <div> \n    <p>Each school has different requirements for standardized testing. Most schools require the SAT or ACT, and many also require SAT subject tests.</p> \n    <p> <strong>You must take either the SAT or ACT to submit an application to UT Austin.</strong> More importantly, you need to do well to have a strong application. </p>\n    <h3>UT Austin SAT Requirements</h3> \n    <p>Many schools say they have no SAT score cutoff, but the truth is that there is a hidden SAT requirement. This is based on the school's average score.</p>  \n    <span></span>\n    <h2>Average SAT: 1350 (Old: 1904)</h2>  \n    <p>The <strong>average SAT score</strong> composite at UT Austin is a <strong>1350</strong> on the 1600 SAT scale.</p> \n    <p>On the <strong>old 2400 SAT</strong>, this corresponds to an <strong>average SAT score of 1904</strong>.</p> \n    <p>This score makes UT Austin <strong>Moderately Competitive</strong> for SAT test scores.</p> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-4.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <br> \n    <h4>UT Austin SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)</h4> \n    <p>The 25th percentile New SAT score is 1240, and the 75th percentile New SAT score is 1450.

This score makes UT Austin <strong>Moderately Competitive</strong> for ACT scores.</p> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-4.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <p>The 25th percentile ACT score is 26, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 31. </p> \n    <p>Even though UT Austin likely says they have no minimum ACT requirement, if you apply with a 26 or below, you'll have a very hard time getting in, unless you have something else very impressive in your application. There are so many applicants scoring 29 and above that a 26 will look academically weak.</p> \n    <h4>ACT Score Sending Policy</h4> \n    <p>If you're taking the ACT as opposed to the SAT, you have a huge advantage in how you send scores, and this dramatically affects your testing strategy.</p> \n    <p>Here it is: <strong>when you send ACT scores to colleges, you have absolute control over which tests you send.</strong> You could take 10 tests, and only send your highest one. This is unlike the SAT, where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken.</p> \n    <p>This means that you have more chances than you think to improve your ACT score. To try to aim for the school's ACT requirement of 29 and above, you should try to take the ACT as many times as you can. When you have the final score that you're happy with, you can then send only that score to all your schools.</p> \n    <h4>ACT Superscore Policy</h4> \n    <p>By and large, most colleges do not superscore the ACT. (Superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit, and then combines them into the best possible composite score). Thus, most schools will just take your highest ACT score from a single sitting.</p> \n    <p>We weren't able to find the school's exact ACT policy, which most likely means that it does not Superscore. Regardless, you can choose your single best ACT score to send in to UT Austin, so you should prep until you reach our recommended target ACT score of 29.</p> \n    <br> \n    <div> \n     <strong>Studying for the ACT instead?

They'll use this as another factor in their admissions consideration.</p> \n    <br> \n    <h3>SAT Subject Test Requirements</h3> \n    <p>Schools vary in their SAT subject test requirements. Typically, selective schools tend to require them, while most schools in the country do not.</p> \n    <p>We did not find information that UT Austin requires SAT subject tests, and so <strong>most likely it does not</strong>. At least 6 months before applying, you should still doublecheck just to make sure, so you have enough time to take the test.</p> \n    <br>  \n    <span></span>\n    <h2>Our Expert's Notes</h2>  \n    <p>We did more detailed research into this school and found the following information.</p> \n    <div> \n     <p>Enrolling students with SAT Writing scores between 600 and 800 and ACT writing scores of 26 or higher earn credit for freshman English (RHE 306) at UT Austin. Additionally, certain majors in Engineering, Geosciences, and Natural Sciences have a \"calculus readiness requirement,\" which can be fulfilled in multiple ways including getting at least a 600 on SAT Math or a 26 on ACT Math. <a href=\"http://bealonghorn.utexas.edu/freshmen/admission/majors\">More on the calculus readiness requirement here.</a> </p> \n     <p><a href=\"http://bealonghorn.utexas.edu/freshmen/admission/testing\">Source</a></p> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n   <br>    \n   <span></span>\n   <h2>Final Admissions Verdict</h2>  \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-4.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>Because this school is <strong>moderately selective, strong academic performance will almost guarantee you admission</strong>. Scoring a 2070 SAT or a 31 ACT or above will nearly guarantee you admission. Because the school admits 40% of all applicants, being far above average raises the admission rate for you to nearly 100%.</p> \n   <p>If you can achieve a high SAT/ACT score, the rest of your application essentially doesn't matter. You still need to meet the rest of the application requirements, and your GPA shouldn't be too far off from the school average of 3.75. But you won't need dazzling extracurriculars and breathtaking letters of recommendation to get in. You can get in based on the merits of your score alone.</p> \n   <p>But if your score is a 1730 SAT or a 26 ACT and below, you have a good chance of being one of the unlucky few to be rejected.</p>     \n   <br> \n   <div> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/adm_cta_img.jpg\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <br> \n    <strong>Want to build the best possible college application?</strong> \n    <div> \n     <p> We can help. <a href=\"https://admissions.prepscholar.com/\"><strong>PrepScholar Admissions</strong></a> is the world's best admissions consulting service.
