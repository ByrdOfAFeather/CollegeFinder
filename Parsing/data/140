This tells you how competitive the school is and how serious their requirements are.</p> \n   <p><strong>The acceptance rate at Paul Smith's College is 86%</strong>. For every 100 applicants, 86 are admitted.</p>  \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-1.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>This means the school is <strong>lightly selective</strong>. The school will have their expected requirements for GPA and SAT/ACT scores. If you meet their requirements, you're almost certain to get an offer of admission. But if you don't meet Paul Smith's College's requirements, you'll be one of the unlucky few people who gets rejected. </p> \n   <br> \n   <div> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/adm_cta_img.jpg\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <br> \n    <strong>Want to build the best possible college application?</strong> \n    <div> \n     <p> We can help. <a href=\"https://admissions.prepscholar.com/\"><strong>PrepScholar Admissions</strong></a> is the world's best admissions consulting service.

For this, we look at the school's average GPA for its current students.</p>  \n   <span></span>\n   <h2>Average GPA: 2.8</h2>  \n   <p>The <strong>average GPA</strong> at Paul Smith's College is <strong>2.8</strong>.</p> \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-3.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>(Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA. </p> \n   <p>With a GPA of 2.8, <strong>Paul Smith's College accepts students with below-average GPAs</strong>. You might have a mix of B's and C's in your high school record. It's best to avoid D's and F's, since application readers might question your commitment to studying and ability to succeed in college. </p> \n   <br> \n   <h3>SAT and ACT Requirements</h3> \n   <div> \n    <p>Each school has different requirements for standardized testing. Most schools require the SAT or ACT, and many also require SAT subject tests.</p> \n    <p> Paul Smith's College recommends that you take the SAT or ACT. This means the test might be optional, but submitting a good SAT/ACT score will boost your application chances, especially since most other students will be submitting their scores. </p>\n    <h3>Paul Smith's College SAT Requirements</h3> \n    <p>Many schools say they have no SAT score cutoff, but the truth is that there is a hidden SAT requirement. This is based on the school's average score.</p>  \n    <span></span>\n    <h2>Average SAT: 1030 (Old: 957)</h2>  \n    <p>The <strong>average SAT score</strong> composite at Paul Smith's College is a <strong>1030</strong> on the 1600 SAT scale.</p> \n    <p>On the <strong>old 2400 SAT</strong>, this corresponds to an <strong>average SAT score of 957</strong>. (According to our records, this school requires only Reading and Math, so this score is out of 1600.)</p> \n    <p>This score makes Paul Smith's College <strong>Lightly Competitive</strong> for SAT test scores.</p> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-2.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <br> \n    <h4>Paul Smith's College SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)</h4> \n    <p>The 25th percentile New SAT score is , and the 75th percentile New SAT score is . In other words, a <strong> on the New SAT places you below average, while a will move you up to above average</strong>.</p> \n    <p>Here's the breakdown of new SAT scores by section:</p> \n    <table> \n     <thead> \n      <tr>\n       <td><strong>Section</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>Average</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>25th Percentile</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>75th Percentile</strong></td>\n      </tr> \n     </thead> \n     <tbody> \n      <tr>\n       <td><strong>Math</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>510</strong></td>\n       <td></td>\n       <td></td>\n      </tr> \n      <tr>\n       <td><strong>Reading</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>26</strong></td>\n       <td></td>\n       <td></td>\n      </tr> \n      <tr>\n       <td><strong>Composite</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>1030</strong></td>\n       <td></td>\n       <td></td>\n      </tr> \n     </tbody> \n    </table> \n    <br> \n    <h4>Paul Smith's College SAT Score Analysis (Old 2400 SAT)</h4> \n    <p>The 25th percentile Old SAT score is 0, and the 75th percentile SAT score is 0. In other words, a <strong>0 on the Old SAT places you below average, while a 0 puts you well above average</strong>.</p> \n    <p>Here's the breakdown of old SAT scores by section:</p> \n    <table> \n     <thead> \n      <tr>\n       <td><strong>Section</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>Average</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>25th Percentile</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>75th Percentile</strong></td>\n      </tr> \n     </thead> \n     <tbody> \n      <tr>\n       <td><strong>Math</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>486</strong></td>\n       <td></td>\n       <td></td>\n      </tr> \n      <tr>\n       <td><strong>Reading</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>471</strong></td>\n       <td></td>\n       <td></td>\n      </tr> \n      <tr>\n       <td><strong>Composite</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>957</strong></td>\n       <td>0</td>\n       <td>0</td>\n      </tr> \n     </tbody> \n    </table> \n    <h3>SAT Score Choice Policy</h3> \n    <p>The Score Choice policy at your school is an important part of your testing strategy.</p>  \n    <br> \n    <h3>Paul Smith's College ACT Requirements</h3> \n    <p>Just like for the SAT, Paul Smith's College likely doesn't have a hard ACT cutoff, but if you score too low, your application will get tossed in the trash.</p>  \n    <span></span>\n    <h2>Average ACT: 21</h2>  \n    <p>The <strong>average ACT</strong> score at Paul Smith's College is 21. This score makes Paul Smith's College <strong>Moderately Competitive</strong> for ACT scores.</p> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-4.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <p>The 25th percentile ACT score is , and the 75th percentile ACT score is . </p> \n    <h4>ACT Score Sending Policy</h4> \n    <p>If you're taking the ACT as opposed to the SAT, you have a huge advantage in how you send scores, and this dramatically affects your testing strategy.</p> \n    <p>Here it is: <strong>when you send ACT scores to colleges, you have absolute control over which tests you send.</strong> You could take 10 tests, and only send your highest one. This is unlike the SAT, where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken.</p> \n    <p>This means that you have more chances than you think to improve your ACT score. To try to aim for the school's ACT requirement of and above, you should try to take the ACT as many times as you can. When you have the final score that you're happy with, you can then send only that score to all your schools.</p> \n    <h4>ACT Superscore Policy</h4> \n    <p>By and large, most colleges do not superscore the ACT. (Superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit, and then combines them into the best possible composite score). Thus, most schools will just take your highest ACT score from a single sitting.</p> \n    <p>We weren't able to find the school's exact ACT policy, which most likely means that it does not Superscore. Regardless, you can choose your single best ACT score to send in to Paul Smith's College, so you should prep until you reach our recommended target ACT score of .</p> \n    <br> \n    <div> \n     <strong>Studying for the ACT instead?

Thus you don't need to worry too much about Writing for this school, but other schools you're applying to may require it.</p> \n    <br> \n    <h3>SAT Subject Test Requirements</h3> \n    <p>Schools vary in their SAT subject test requirements. Typically, selective schools tend to require them, while most schools in the country do not.</p> \n    <p>We did not find information that Paul Smith's College requires SAT subject tests, and so <strong>most likely it does not</strong>. At least 6 months before applying, you should still doublecheck just to make sure, so you have enough time to take the test.</p> \n    <br> \n   </div> \n   <br>    \n   <span></span>\n   <h2>Final Admissions Verdict</h2>  \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-2.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>Because this school is <strong>lightly selective, you have a great shot at getting in, as long as you don't fall well below average</strong>. Aim for a 0 SAT or a ACT or higher, and you'll almost certainly get an offer of admission.
