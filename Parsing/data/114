This tells you how competitive the school is and how serious their requirements are.</p> \n   <p><strong>The acceptance rate at Medgar Evers College (City University of New York) is 91%</strong>. For every 100 applicants, 91 are admitted.</p>  \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-1.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>This means the school is a nearly open admissions school.

For this, we look at the school's average GPA for its current students.</p>  \n   <span></span>\n   <h2>Average GPA: 2.85</h2>  \n   <p>The <strong>average GPA</strong> at Medgar Evers College (City University of New York) is <strong>2.85</strong>.</p> \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-3.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>(Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA. This school did not officially report its average GPA, but we've estimated it here using data from over 1,000 schools.) </p> \n   <p>With a GPA of 2.85, <strong>Medgar Evers College (City University of New York) accepts students with below-average GPAs</strong>. You might have a mix of B's and C's in your high school record. It's best to avoid D's and F's, since application readers might question your commitment to studying and ability to succeed in college. </p> \n   <br> \n   <h3>SAT and ACT Requirements</h3> \n   <div> \n    <p>Each school has different requirements for standardized testing. Most schools require the SAT or ACT, and many also require SAT subject tests.</p> \n    <p> Medgar Evers College (City University of New York) recommends that you take the SAT or ACT. This means the test might be optional, but submitting a good SAT/ACT score will boost your application chances, especially since most other students will be submitting their scores. </p>\n    <h3>Medgar Evers College (City University of New York) SAT Requirements</h3> \n    <p>Many schools say they have no SAT score cutoff, but the truth is that there is a hidden SAT requirement. This is based on the school's average score.</p>  \n    <span></span>\n    <h2>Average SAT: 870 (Old: 1160)</h2>  \n    <p>The <strong>average SAT score</strong> composite at Medgar Evers College (City University of New York) is a <strong>870</strong> on the 1600 SAT scale.</p> \n    <p>On the <strong>old 2400 SAT</strong>, this corresponds to an <strong>average SAT score of 1160</strong>.</p> \n    <p>This score makes Medgar Evers College (City University of New York) <strong>Competitive</strong> for SAT test scores.</p> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-3.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <br> \n    <h4>Medgar Evers College (City University of New York) SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)</h4> \n    <p>The 25th percentile New SAT score is 780, and the 75th percentile New SAT score is 960.

Thus you don't need to worry too much about Writing for this school, but other schools you're applying to may require it.</p> \n    <br> \n    <h3>SAT Subject Test Requirements</h3> \n    <p>Schools vary in their SAT subject test requirements. Typically, selective schools tend to require them, while most schools in the country do not.</p> \n    <p>Medgar Evers College (City University of New York) <strong>requires SAT Subject Tests if you're submitting an SAT score, not an ACT score</strong>. If you submit an ACT score with Writing, you do not need SAT subject tests.</p> \n    <p>Typically, your SAT/ACT and GPA are far more heavily weighed than your SAT Subject Tests. If you have the choice between improving your SAT/ACT score or your SAT Subject Test scores, <strong>definitely choose to improve your SAT/ACT score</strong>.</p> \n    <br> \n   </div> \n   <br>    \n   <span></span>\n   <h2>Final Admissions Verdict</h2>  \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-3.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>This school offers nearly open admissions, which means they give almost every student an offer of admission. <strong>To be safe, you should aim for a 1020 SAT or higher</strong>.
