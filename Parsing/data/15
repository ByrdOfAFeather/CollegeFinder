For this, we look at the school's average GPA for its current students.</p>  \n   <span></span>\n   <h2>Average GPA: 3.83</h2>  \n   <p>The <strong>average GPA</strong> at UMass is <strong>3.83</strong>.</p> \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-6.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>(Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA. </p> \n   <p>With a GPA of 3.83, <strong>UMass requires you to be near the top of your class</strong>, and well above average. Your transcript should show mostly A's. Ideally, you will also have taken several AP or IB classes to show that you can handle academics at a college level. </p> \n   <p> If you're currently a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change in time for college applications. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 3.83, <strong>you'll need a higher SAT or ACT score to compensate</strong>. This will help you compete effectively against other applicants who have higher GPAs than you. </p> \n   <br> \n   <h3>SAT and ACT Requirements</h3> \n   <div> \n    <p>Each school has different requirements for standardized testing. Most schools require the SAT or ACT, and many also require SAT subject tests.</p> \n    <p> <strong>You must take either the SAT or ACT to submit an application to UMass.</strong> More importantly, you need to do well to have a strong application. </p>\n    <h3>UMass SAT Requirements</h3> \n    <p>Many schools say they have no SAT score cutoff, but the truth is that there is a hidden SAT requirement. This is based on the school's average score.</p>  \n    <span></span>\n    <h2>Average SAT: 1290 (Old: 1226)</h2>  \n    <p>The <strong>average SAT score</strong> composite at UMass is a <strong>1290</strong> on the 1600 SAT scale.</p> \n    <p>On the <strong>old 2400 SAT</strong>, this corresponds to an <strong>average SAT score of 1226</strong>. (According to our records, this school requires only Reading and Math, so this score is out of 1600.)</p> \n    <p>This score makes UMass <strong>Competitive</strong> for SAT test scores.</p> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-3.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <br> \n    <h4>UMass SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)</h4> \n    <p>The 25th percentile New SAT score is 1200, and the 75th percentile New SAT score is 1380.

Because you can choose which tests to send in, and UMass forms your Superscore, <strong>you can take the SAT as many times as you want, then submit only the tests that give you the highest Superscore. </strong>Your application readers will only see that one score.</p> \n     </div> \n    </div> \n    <p>Therefore, if your SAT superscore is currently below a 1290, <strong>we strongly recommend that you consider prepping for the SAT and retaking it</strong>. You have a very good chance of raising your score, which will significantly boost your chances of getting in.</p> \n    <p>Even better, because of the Superscore, you can focus all your energy on a single section at a time. If your Reading score is lower than your other sections, prep only for the Reading section, then take the SAT. Then focus on Math for the next test, and so on. This will surely give you the highest Superscore possible.</p> \n    <br> \n    <div> \n     <strong>Exclusive: Want to learn how to improve your SAT score by 160 points?</strong> \n     <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/guide-sat.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n     <div> \n      <p><a href=\"https://www.prepscholar.com/sat/l/tour_sat_guide\">Download our free guide</a> on the top 5 strategies you must be using to improve your score.

This score makes UMass <strong>Moderately Competitive</strong> for ACT scores.</p> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-4.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <p>The 25th percentile ACT score is 25, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 30. </p> \n    <p>Even though UMass likely says they have no minimum ACT requirement, if you apply with a 25 or below, you'll have a harder time getting in, unless you have something else impressive in your application.</p> \n    <h4>ACT Score Sending Policy</h4> \n    <p>If you're taking the ACT as opposed to the SAT, you have a huge advantage in how you send scores, and this dramatically affects your testing strategy.</p> \n    <p>Here it is: <strong>when you send ACT scores to colleges, you have absolute control over which tests you send.</strong> You could take 10 tests, and only send your highest one. This is unlike the SAT, where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken.</p> \n    <p>This means that you have more chances than you think to improve your ACT score. To try to aim for the school's ACT requirement of 27 and above, you should try to take the ACT as many times as you can. When you have the final score that you're happy with, you can then send only that score to all your schools.</p> \n    <h4>ACT Superscore Policy</h4> \n    <p>By and large, most colleges do not superscore the ACT. (Superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit, and then combines them into the best possible composite score). Thus, most schools will just take your highest ACT score from a single sitting.</p> \n    <p>However, from our research, <strong>UMass is understood to superscore the ACT</strong>. We couldn't confirm it directly from the school's admissions website, but multiple sources confirm that the school does superscore the ACT. We recommend you call their admissions office directly for more information.</p> \n    <p><a href=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/sat/s/colleges/UMass-admission-requirements\">Source</a></p> \n    <p>Superscoring is powerful to your testing strategy, and you need to make sure you plan your testing accordingly. Of all the scores that UMass receives, your application readers will consider your <strong>highest section scores across all ACT test dates you submit</strong>.</p> \n    <p>Click below to learn more about how superscoring critically affects your test strategy.</p> \n    <div> \n     <a href=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/sat/s/colleges/UMass-admission-requirements#\">How does superscoring change your test strategy? <span>(Click to Learn)</span></a> \n     <div> \n      <p>For example, say you submit the following 4 test scores:</p> \n      <table> \n       <tbody>\n        <tr> \n         <th> </th> \n         <th>English</th> \n         <th>Math</th> \n         <th>Reading</th> \n         <th>Science</th> \n         <th>Composite</th> \n        </tr> \n        <tr> \n         <td>Test 1</td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>20</td> \n        </tr> \n        <tr> \n         <td>Test 2</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>20</td> \n        </tr> \n        <tr> \n         <td>Test 3</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>20</td> \n        </tr> \n        <tr> \n         <td>Test 4</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td>16</td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td>20</td> \n        </tr> \n        <tr> \n         <td><strong>Superscore</strong></td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n         <td><strong>32</strong></td> \n        </tr> \n       </tbody>\n      </table> \n      <p>Even though the highest ACT composite you scored on any one test date was 20, UMass will take your highest section score from all your test dates, then combine them to form your Superscore. <strong>You can raise your composite score from 20 to 32 in this example.</strong></p> \n      <p>This is important for your testing strategy.

If you do well, they'll consider your application to be stronger.</p> \n    <br> \n    <h3>SAT Subject Test Requirements</h3> \n    <p>Schools vary in their SAT subject test requirements. Typically, selective schools tend to require them, while most schools in the country do not.</p> \n    <p>We did not find information that UMass requires SAT subject tests, and so <strong>most likely it does not</strong>. At least 6 months before applying, you should still doublecheck just to make sure, so you have enough time to take the test.</p> \n    <br> \n   </div> \n   <br>    \n   <span></span>\n   <h2>Final Admissions Verdict</h2>  \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-4.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>Because this school is <strong>moderately selective, strong academic performance will almost guarantee you admission</strong>. Scoring a 1310 SAT or a 30 ACT or above will nearly guarantee you admission. Because the school admits 58% of all applicants, being far above average raises the admission rate for you to nearly 100%.</p> \n   <p>If you can achieve a high SAT/ACT score, the rest of your application essentially doesn't matter. You still need to meet the rest of the application requirements, and your GPA shouldn't be too far off from the school average of 3.83. But you won't need dazzling extracurriculars and breathtaking letters of recommendation to get in.
