While there are a lot of pieces that go into a college application, <strong>you should focus on only a few critical things:</strong></p> \n   <ul> \n    <li><strong>GPA requirements</strong></li> \n    <li>Testing requirements, including <strong>SAT and ACT requirements</strong></li> \n    <li><strong>Application requirements</strong></li> \n   </ul> \n   <p>In this guide we'll cover what you need to get into Yale and build a strong application.</p> \n   <p>School location: New Haven, CT</p> \n   <p>This school is also known as: Yale University</p>   \n   <br>   \n   <span></span>\n   <h2>Admissions Rate: 7%</h2>  \n   <p>If you want to get in, the first thing to look at is the acceptance rate. This tells you how competitive the school is and how serious their requirements are.</p> \n   <p><strong>The acceptance rate at Yale is 7%</strong>. For every 100 applicants, only 7 are admitted.</p>  \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-6.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>This means the school is <strong>extremely selective</strong>. Meeting their GPA requirements and SAT/ACT requirements is very important to getting past their first round of filters and proving your academic preparation. If you don't meet their expectations, your chance of getting is nearly zero.</p>\n   <p>After crossing this hurdle, you'll need to impress Yale application readers through their other application requirements, including extracurriculars, essays, and letters of recommendation. We'll cover more below. </p> \n   <br> \n   <div> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/adm_cta_img.jpg\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <br> \n    <strong>Want to build the best possible college application?</strong> \n    <div> \n     <p> We can help. <a href=\"https://admissions.prepscholar.com/\"><strong>PrepScholar Admissions</strong></a> is the world's best admissions consulting service.

For this, we look at the school's average GPA for its current students.</p>  \n   <span></span>\n   <h2>Average GPA: 4.19</h2>  \n   <p>The <strong>average GPA</strong> at Yale is <strong>4.19</strong>.</p> \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-6.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>(Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA. This school did not officially report its average GPA, but we've estimated it here using data from over 1,000 schools.) </p> \n   <p>With a GPA of 4.19, <strong>Yale requires you to be at the top of your class</strong>. You'll need nearly straight A's in all your classes to compete with other applicants. Furthermore, you should be taking hard classes - AP or IB courses - to show that college-level academics is a breeze. </p> \n   <p> If you're currently a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change in time for college applications. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 4.19, <strong>you'll need a higher SAT or ACT score to compensate</strong>. This will help you compete effectively against other applicants who have higher GPAs than you. </p> \n   <br> \n   <h3>SAT and ACT Requirements</h3> \n   <div> \n    <p>Each school has different requirements for standardized testing. Most schools require the SAT or ACT, and many also require SAT subject tests.</p> \n    <p> <strong>You must take either the SAT or ACT to submit an application to Yale.</strong> More importantly, you need to do well to have a strong application. </p>\n    <h3>Yale SAT Requirements</h3> \n    <p>Many schools say they have no SAT score cutoff, but the truth is that there is a hidden SAT requirement. This is based on the school's average score.</p>  \n    <span></span>\n    <h2>Average SAT: 1540 (Old: 2265)</h2>  \n    <p>The <strong>average SAT score</strong> composite at Yale is a <strong>1540</strong> on the 1600 SAT scale.</p> \n    <p>On the <strong>old 2400 SAT</strong>, this corresponds to an <strong>average SAT score of 2265</strong>.</p> \n    <p>This score makes Yale <strong>Extremely Competitive</strong> for SAT test scores.</p> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-6.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <br> \n    <h4>Yale SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)</h4> \n    <p>The 25th percentile New SAT score is 1490, and the 75th percentile New SAT score is 1600.

In other words, a <strong>2140 on the Old SAT places you below average, while a 2390 puts you well above average</strong>.</p> \n    <p>Here's the breakdown of old SAT scores by section:</p> \n    <table> \n     <thead> \n      <tr>\n       <td><strong>Section</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>Average</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>25th Percentile</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>75th Percentile</strong></td>\n      </tr> \n     </thead> \n     <tbody> \n      <tr>\n       <td><strong>Math</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>755</strong></td>\n       <td>710</td>\n       <td>800</td>\n      </tr> \n      <tr>\n       <td><strong>Reading</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>760</strong></td>\n       <td>720</td>\n       <td>800</td>\n      </tr> \n      <tr>\n       <td><strong>Writing</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>750</strong></td>\n       <td>710</td>\n       <td>790</td>\n      </tr> \n      <tr>\n       <td><strong>Composite</strong></td>\n       <td><strong>2265</strong></td>\n       <td>2140</td>\n       <td>2390</td>\n      </tr> \n     </tbody> \n    </table> \n    <h3>SAT Score Choice Policy</h3> \n    <p>The Score Choice policy at your school is an important part of your testing strategy.</p> \n    <p>Yale has the Score Choice policy of <strong>\"All Scores.\"</strong></p> \n    <p>This means that Yale requires you to send all SAT scores you've ever taken to their office.</p> \n    <p>This sounds daunting, but most schools don't actually consider all your scores equally. For example, if you scored an 1300 on one test and a 1500 on another, they won't actually average the two tests.</p> \n    <p>In fact, we researched the score policies at Yale, and they have the following policy:</p> \n    <p>With a full testing history, the committee is able to look at a student's highest officially reported score on each section of the SAT, the highest individual SAT Subject Tests, and/or the highest ACT Plus Writing composite score.</p> \n    <p><a href=\"http://admissions.yale.edu/standardized-testing\">Source</a></p> \n    <p>Some students are still worried about submitting too many test scores. They're afraid that Yale will look down on too many attempts to raise your score. But how many is too many?</p> \n    <p>From our research and talking to admissions officers, we've learned that <strong>4-6 tests is a safe number to submit</strong>. The college understands that you want to have the best chance of admission, and retaking the test is a good way to do this. Within a reasonable number of tests, they honestly don't care how many times you've taken it. They'll just focus on your score.</p> \n    <p>If you take it more than 6 times, colleges start wondering why you're not improving with each test. They'll question your study skills and ability to improve.</p> \n    <p>But below 6 tests, we strongly encourage retaking the test to maximize your chances. If your SAT score is currently below a 1600, <strong>we strongly recommend that you consider prepping for the SAT and retaking it</strong>. You don't have much to lose, and you can potentially raise your score and significantly boost your chances of getting in.</p> \n    <br> \n    <div> \n     <strong>Exclusive: Want to learn how to improve your SAT score by 160 points?</strong> \n     <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/guide-sat.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n     <div> \n      <p><a href=\"https://www.prepscholar.com/sat/l/tour_sat_guide\">Download our free guide</a> on the top 5 strategies you must be using to improve your score.

This score makes Yale <strong>Strongly Competitive</strong> for ACT scores.</p> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-5.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <p>The 25th percentile ACT score is 31, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 35. </p> \n    <p>Even though Yale likely says they have no minimum ACT requirement, if you apply with a 31 or below, you'll have a very hard time getting in, unless you have something else very impressive in your application. There are so many applicants scoring 33 and above that a 31 will look academically weak.</p> \n    <h4>ACT Score Sending Policy</h4> \n    <p>If you're taking the ACT as opposed to the SAT, you have a huge advantage in how you send scores, and this dramatically affects your testing strategy.</p> \n    <p>Here it is: <strong>when you send ACT scores to colleges, you have absolute control over which tests you send.</strong> You could take 10 tests, and only send your highest one. This is unlike the SAT, where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken.</p> \n    <p>This means that you have more chances than you think to improve your ACT score. To try to aim for the school's ACT requirement of 35 and above, you should try to take the ACT as many times as you can. When you have the final score that you're happy with, you can then send only that score to all your schools.</p> \n    <h4>ACT Superscore Policy</h4> \n    <p>By and large, most colleges do not superscore the ACT. (Superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit, and then combines them into the best possible composite score). Thus, most schools will just take your highest ACT score from a single sitting.</p> \n    <p>We weren't able to find the school's exact ACT policy, which most likely means that it does not Superscore. Regardless, you can choose your single best ACT score to send in to Yale, so you should prep until you reach our recommended target ACT score of 35.</p> \n    <br> \n    <div> \n     <strong>Studying for the ACT instead?

They'll use this as another factor in their admissions consideration.</p> \n    <br> \n    <h3>SAT Subject Test Requirements</h3> \n    <p>Schools vary in their SAT subject test requirements. Typically, selective schools tend to require them, while most schools in the country do not.</p> \n    <p>Yale <strong>requires SAT Subject Tests if you're submitting an SAT score, not an ACT score</strong>. If you submit an ACT score with Writing, you do not need SAT subject tests.</p> \n    <p>Typically, your SAT/ACT and GPA are far more heavily weighed than your SAT Subject Tests. If you have the choice between improving your SAT/ACT score or your SAT Subject Test scores, <strong>definitely choose to improve your SAT/ACT score</strong>.</p> \n    <br>  \n    <span></span>\n    <h2>Our Expert's Notes</h2>  \n    <p>We did more detailed research into this school and found the following information.</p> \n    <div> \n     <p>Yale does not participate in Score Choice. Therefore, you need to report to Yale the results of all SAT and SAT Subject Tests or all ACT tests that you have taken.</p> \n     <p><a href=\"http://admissions.yale.edu/standardized-testing\">Source</a></p> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n   <br>    \n   <span></span>\n   <h2>Final Admissions Verdict</h2>  \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-6.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>Because this school is <strong>extremely selective, getting a high SAT/ACT score and GPA is vital to having a chance at getting in</strong>. If you don't pass their SAT/ACT and GPA requirements, they'll likely reject you without much consideration.</p> \n   <p><strong>To have the best shot of getting in, you should aim for the 75th percentile, with a 2390 SAT or a 35 ACT</strong>. You should also have a 4.19 GPA or higher. If your GPA is lower than this, you need to compensate with a higher SAT/ACT score.</p> \n   <p>For a school as selective as Yale, you'll also need to impress them with the rest of your application. We'll cover those details next.</p> \n   <p>But if you apply with a score below a 2390 SAT or a 35 ACT, you unfortunately start out with the odds against you and have a tiny chance of getting in. There are just too many students with high SAT/ACT scores and strong applications, and you need to compete against them.</p>     \n   <br> \n   <div> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/adm_cta_img.jpg\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <br> \n    <strong>Want to build the best possible college application?</strong> \n    <div> \n     <p> We can help. <a href=\"https://admissions.prepscholar.com/\"><strong>PrepScholar Admissions</strong></a> is the world's best admissions consulting service.
