While there are a lot of pieces that go into a college application, <strong>you should focus on only a few critical things:</strong></p> \n   <ul> \n    <li><strong>GPA requirements</strong></li> \n    <li>Testing requirements, including <strong>SAT and ACT requirements</strong></li> \n    <li><strong>Application requirements</strong></li> \n   </ul> \n   <p>In this guide we'll cover what you need to get into Dartmouth and build a strong application.</p> \n   <p>School location: Hanover, NH</p> \n   <p>This school is also known as: Dartmouth College</p>   \n   <br>   \n   <span></span>\n   <h2>Admissions Rate: 11%</h2>  \n   <p>If you want to get in, the first thing to look at is the acceptance rate. This tells you how competitive the school is and how serious their requirements are.</p> \n   <p><strong>The acceptance rate at Dartmouth is 11%</strong>. For every 100 applicants, only 11 are admitted.</p>  \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-6.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>This means the school is <strong>extremely selective</strong>. Meeting their GPA requirements and SAT/ACT requirements is very important to getting past their first round of filters and proving your academic preparation. If you don't meet their expectations, your chance of getting is nearly zero.</p>\n   <p>After crossing this hurdle, you'll need to impress Dartmouth application readers through their other application requirements, including extracurriculars, essays, and letters of recommendation.

For this, we look at the school's average GPA for its current students.</p>  \n   <span></span>\n   <h2>Average GPA: 4.06</h2>  \n   <p>The <strong>average GPA</strong> at Dartmouth is <strong>4.06</strong>.</p> \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-6.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>(Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA. This school did not officially report its average GPA, but we've estimated it here using data from over 1,000 schools.) </p> \n   <p>With a GPA of 4.06, <strong>Dartmouth requires you to be at the top of your class</strong>. You'll need nearly straight A's in all your classes to compete with other applicants. Furthermore, you should be taking hard classes - AP or IB courses - to show that college-level academics is a breeze. </p> \n   <p> If you're currently a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change in time for college applications. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 4.06, <strong>you'll need a higher SAT or ACT score to compensate</strong>. This will help you compete effectively against other applicants who have higher GPAs than you. </p> \n   <br> \n   <h3>SAT and ACT Requirements</h3> \n   <div> \n    <p>Each school has different requirements for standardized testing. Most schools require the SAT or ACT, and many also require SAT subject tests.</p> \n    <p> <strong>You must take either the SAT or ACT to submit an application to Dartmouth.</strong> More importantly, you need to do well to have a strong application. </p>\n    <h3>Dartmouth SAT Requirements</h3> \n    <p>Many schools say they have no SAT score cutoff, but the truth is that there is a hidden SAT requirement. This is based on the school's average score.</p>  \n    <span></span>\n    <h2>Average SAT: 1500 (Old: 2160)</h2>  \n    <p>The <strong>average SAT score</strong> composite at Dartmouth is a <strong>1500</strong> on the 1600 SAT scale.</p> \n    <p>On the <strong>old 2400 SAT</strong>, this corresponds to an <strong>average SAT score of 2160</strong>.</p> \n    <p>This score makes Dartmouth <strong>Strongly Competitive</strong> for SAT test scores.</p> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-5.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <br> \n    <h4>Dartmouth SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)</h4> \n    <p>The 25th percentile New SAT score is 1410, and the 75th percentile New SAT score is 1580.

Of all the scores they receive, your application readers will consider your <strong>highest section scores across all SAT test dates you submit</strong>.</p> \n    <p>Click below to learn more about how superscoring critically affects your test strategy.</p> \n    <div> \n     <a href=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/sat/s/colleges/Dartmouth-admission-requirements#\">How does superscoring change your test strategy? <span>(Click to Learn)</span></a> \n     <div> \n      <p>For example, say you submit the following 3 test scores:</p> \n      <div> \n       <table> \n        <thead> \n         <tr> \n          <td>Section</td> \n          <td>R+W</td> \n          <td>Math</td> \n          <td>Composite</td> \n         </tr> \n        </thead> \n        <tbody> \n         <tr> \n          <td><strong>Test 1</strong></td> \n          <td>700</td> \n          <td>300</td> \n          <td>1000</td> \n         </tr> \n         <tr> \n          <td><strong>Test 2</strong></td> \n          <td>300</td> \n          <td>700</td> \n          <td>1000</td> \n         </tr> \n         <tr> \n          <td><strong>Test 3</strong></td> \n          <td>300</td> \n          <td>300</td> \n          <td>600</td> \n         </tr> \n         <tr> \n          <td><strong>Superscore</strong></td> \n          <td>700</td> \n          <td>700</td> \n          <td>1400</td> \n         </tr> \n        </tbody> \n       </table> \n      </div> \n      <p>Even though the highest total you scored on any one test date was 1000, Dartmouth will take your highest section score from all your test dates, then combine them to form your Superscore.<strong> You can raise your composite score from 1000 to 1400 in this example.</strong></p> \n      <p>This is important for your testing strategy. Because you can choose which tests to send in, and Dartmouth forms your Superscore, <strong>you can take the SAT as many times as you want, then submit only the tests that give you the highest Superscore. </strong>Your application readers will only see that one score.</p> \n     </div> \n    </div> \n    <p>Therefore, if your SAT superscore is currently below a 1580, <strong>we strongly recommend that you consider prepping for the SAT and retaking it</strong>. You have a very good chance of raising your score, which will significantly boost your chances of getting in.</p> \n    <p>Even better, because of the Superscore, you can focus all your energy on a single section at a time. If your Reading score is lower than your other sections, prep only for the Reading section, then take the SAT. Then focus on Math for the next test, and so on. This will surely give you the highest Superscore possible.</p> \n    <br> \n    <div> \n     <strong>Exclusive: Want to learn how to improve your SAT score by 160 points?</strong> \n     <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/guide-sat.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n     <div> \n      <p><a href=\"https://www.prepscholar.com/sat/l/tour_sat_guide\">Download our free guide</a> on the top 5 strategies you must be using to improve your score.

This score makes Dartmouth <strong>Strongly Competitive</strong> for ACT scores.</p> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-5.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <p>The 25th percentile ACT score is 30, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 34. </p> \n    <p>Even though Dartmouth likely says they have no minimum ACT requirement, if you apply with a 30 or below, you'll have a very hard time getting in, unless you have something else very impressive in your application. There are so many applicants scoring 32 and above that a 30 will look academically weak.</p> \n    <h4>ACT Score Sending Policy</h4> \n    <p>If you're taking the ACT as opposed to the SAT, you have a huge advantage in how you send scores, and this dramatically affects your testing strategy.</p> \n    <p>Here it is: <strong>when you send ACT scores to colleges, you have absolute control over which tests you send.</strong> You could take 10 tests, and only send your highest one. This is unlike the SAT, where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken.</p> \n    <p>This means that you have more chances than you think to improve your ACT score. To try to aim for the school's ACT requirement of 34 and above, you should try to take the ACT as many times as you can. When you have the final score that you're happy with, you can then send only that score to all your schools.</p> \n    <h4>ACT Superscore Policy</h4> \n    <p>By and large, most colleges do not superscore the ACT. (Superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit, and then combines them into the best possible composite score). Thus, most schools will just take your highest ACT score from a single sitting.</p> \n    <p>We weren't able to find the school's exact ACT policy, which most likely means that it does not Superscore. Regardless, you can choose your single best ACT score to send in to Dartmouth, so you should prep until you reach our recommended target ACT score of 34.</p> \n    <br> \n    <div> \n     <strong>Studying for the ACT instead?

They'll use this as another factor in their admissions consideration.</p> \n    <br> \n    <h3>SAT Subject Test Requirements</h3> \n    <p>Schools vary in their SAT subject test requirements. Typically, selective schools tend to require them, while most schools in the country do not.</p> \n    <p>Dartmouth has indicated that <strong>SAT subject tests are required for admission</strong>. Read further to see how many and which ones they require.</p> \n    <p>Typically, your SAT/ACT and GPA are far more heavily weighed than your SAT Subject Tests. If you have the choice between improving your SAT/ACT score or your SAT Subject Test scores, <strong>definitely choose to improve your SAT/ACT score</strong>.</p> \n    <br>  \n    <span></span>\n    <h2>Our Expert's Notes</h2>  \n    <p>We did more detailed research into this school and found the following information.</p> \n    <div> \n     <p>Two SAT subject tests are required in addition to the ACT or SAT. <a href=\"http://admissions.dartmouth.edu/apply/choose-your-path/regular-decision/testing\">Read more about Dartmouth's testing policy here.</a> </p> \n     <p><a href=\"http://admissions.dartmouth.edu/apply/choose-your-path/regular-decision/testing\">Source</a></p> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n   <br>    \n   <span></span>\n   <h2>Final Admissions Verdict</h2>  \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-5.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>Because this school is <strong>extremely selective, getting a high SAT/ACT score and GPA is vital to having a chance at getting in</strong>. If you don't pass their SAT/ACT and GPA requirements, they'll likely reject you without much consideration.</p> \n   <p><strong>To have the best shot of getting in, you should aim for the 75th percentile, with a 2340 SAT or a 34 ACT</strong>. You should also have a 4.06 GPA or higher. If your GPA is lower than this, you need to compensate with a higher SAT/ACT score.</p> \n   <p>For a school as selective as Dartmouth, you'll also need to impress them with the rest of your application. We'll cover those details next.</p> \n   <p>But if you apply with a score below a 2340 SAT or a 34 ACT, you unfortunately start out with the odds against you and have a tiny chance of getting in. There are just too many students with high SAT/ACT scores and strong applications, and you need to compete against them.</p>     \n   <br> \n   <div> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/adm_cta_img.jpg\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <br> \n    <strong>Want to build the best possible college application?</strong> \n    <div> \n     <p> We can help. <a href=\"https://admissions.prepscholar.com/\"><strong>PrepScholar Admissions</strong></a> is the world's best admissions consulting service.
