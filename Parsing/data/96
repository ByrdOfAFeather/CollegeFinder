This tells you how competitive the school is and how serious their requirements are.</p> \n   <p><strong>The acceptance rate at Southern Vermont College is 63%</strong>. For every 100 applicants, 63 are admitted.</p>  \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-3.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>This means the school is <strong>moderately selective</strong>. The school expects you to meet their requirements for GPA and SAT/ACT scores, but they're more flexible than other schools. If you exceed their requirements, you have an excellent chance of getting in. But if you don't, you might be one of the unlucky minority that gets a rejection letter. </p> \n   <br> \n   <div> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/adm_cta_img.jpg\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <br> \n    <strong>Want to build the best possible college application?</strong> \n    <div> \n     <p> We can help. <a href=\"https://admissions.prepscholar.com/\"><strong>PrepScholar Admissions</strong></a> is the world's best admissions consulting service.

For this, we look at the school's average GPA for its current students.</p>  \n   <span></span>\n   <h2>Average GPA: 2.5</h2>  \n   <p>The <strong>average GPA</strong> at Southern Vermont College is <strong>2.5</strong>.</p> \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-3.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>(Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA. </p> \n   <p>With a GPA of 2.5, <strong>Southern Vermont College accepts students with below-average GPAs</strong>. You might have a mix of B's and C's in your high school record. It's best to avoid D's and F's, since application readers might question your commitment to studying and ability to succeed in college. </p> \n   <p> If you're currently a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change in time for college applications. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 2.5, <strong>you'll need a higher SAT or ACT score to compensate</strong>. This will help you compete effectively against other applicants who have higher GPAs than you. </p> \n   <br> \n   <h3>SAT and ACT Requirements</h3> \n   <div> \n    <p>Each school has different requirements for standardized testing. Most schools require the SAT or ACT, and many also require SAT subject tests.</p> \n    <p> <strong>You must take either the SAT or ACT to submit an application to Southern Vermont College.</strong> More importantly, you need to do well to have a strong application. </p>\n    <h3>Southern Vermont College SAT Requirements</h3> \n    <p>Many schools say they have no SAT score cutoff, but the truth is that there is a hidden SAT requirement.

Of all the scores they receive, your application readers will consider your <strong>highest section scores across all SAT test dates you submit</strong>.</p> \n    <p>Click below to learn more about how superscoring critically affects your test strategy.</p> \n    <div> \n     <a href=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/sat/s/colleges/Southern-Vermont-College-admission-requirements#\">How does superscoring change your test strategy? <span>(Click to Learn)</span></a> \n     <div> \n      <p>For example, say you submit the following 3 test scores:</p> \n      <div> \n       <table> \n        <thead> \n         <tr> \n          <td>Section</td> \n          <td>R+W</td> \n          <td>Math</td> \n          <td>Composite</td> \n         </tr> \n        </thead> \n        <tbody> \n         <tr> \n          <td><strong>Test 1</strong></td> \n          <td>700</td> \n          <td>300</td> \n          <td>1000</td> \n         </tr> \n         <tr> \n          <td><strong>Test 2</strong></td> \n          <td>300</td> \n          <td>700</td> \n          <td>1000</td> \n         </tr> \n         <tr> \n          <td><strong>Test 3</strong></td> \n          <td>300</td> \n          <td>300</td> \n          <td>600</td> \n         </tr> \n         <tr> \n          <td><strong>Superscore</strong></td> \n          <td>700</td> \n          <td>700</td> \n          <td>1400</td> \n         </tr> \n        </tbody> \n       </table> \n      </div> \n      <p>Even though the highest total you scored on any one test date was 1000, Southern Vermont College will take your highest section score from all your test dates, then combine them to form your Superscore.<strong> You can raise your composite score from 1000 to 1400 in this example.</strong></p> \n      <p>This is important for your testing strategy. Because you can choose which tests to send in, and Southern Vermont College forms your Superscore, <strong>you can take the SAT as many times as you want, then submit only the tests that give you the highest Superscore. </strong>Your application readers will only see that one score.</p> \n     </div> \n    </div> \n    <p>Therefore, if your SAT superscore is currently below a 970, <strong>we strongly recommend that you consider prepping for the SAT and retaking it</strong>. You have a very good chance of raising your score, which will significantly boost your chances of getting in.</p> \n    <p>Even better, because of the Superscore, you can focus all your energy on a single section at a time. If your Reading score is lower than your other sections, prep only for the Reading section, then take the SAT. Then focus on Math for the next test, and so on. This will surely give you the highest Superscore possible.</p> \n    <br> \n    <div> \n     <strong>Exclusive: Want to learn how to improve your SAT score by 160 points?</strong> \n     <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/guide-sat.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n     <div> \n      <p><a href=\"https://www.prepscholar.com/sat/l/tour_sat_guide\">Download our free guide</a> on the top 5 strategies you must be using to improve your score.

This score makes Southern Vermont College <strong>Competitive</strong> for ACT scores.</p> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-3.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <p>The 25th percentile ACT score is 15, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 19. </p> \n    <p>Even though Southern Vermont College likely says they have no minimum ACT requirement, if you apply with a 15 or below, you'll have a harder time getting in, unless you have something else impressive in your application.</p> \n    <h4>ACT Score Sending Policy</h4> \n    <p>If you're taking the ACT as opposed to the SAT, you have a huge advantage in how you send scores, and this dramatically affects your testing strategy.</p> \n    <p>Here it is: <strong>when you send ACT scores to colleges, you have absolute control over which tests you send.</strong> You could take 10 tests, and only send your highest one. This is unlike the SAT, where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken.</p> \n    <p>This means that you have more chances than you think to improve your ACT score. To try to aim for the school's ACT requirement of 18 and above, you should try to take the ACT as many times as you can. When you have the final score that you're happy with, you can then send only that score to all your schools.</p> \n    <h4>ACT Superscore Policy</h4> \n    <p>By and large, most colleges do not superscore the ACT. (Superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit, and then combines them into the best possible composite score). Thus, most schools will just take your highest ACT score from a single sitting.</p> \n    <p>We weren't able to find the school's exact ACT policy, which most likely means that it does not Superscore. Regardless, you can choose your single best ACT score to send in to Southern Vermont College, so you should prep until you reach our recommended target ACT score of 18.</p> \n    <br> \n    <div> \n     <strong>Studying for the ACT instead?

You don't need to worry too much about Writing for this school, but other schools you're applying to may require it.</p> \n    <br> \n    <h3>SAT Subject Test Requirements</h3> \n    <p>Schools vary in their SAT subject test requirements. Typically, selective schools tend to require them, while most schools in the country do not.</p> \n    <p>We did not find information that Southern Vermont College requires SAT subject tests, and so <strong>most likely it does not</strong>. At least 6 months before applying, you should still doublecheck just to make sure, so you have enough time to take the test.</p> \n    <br> \n   </div> \n   <br>    \n   <span></span>\n   <h2>Final Admissions Verdict</h2>  \n   <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/meter-comp-3.png\" alt=\"image description\"> \n   <p>Because this school is <strong>moderately selective, strong academic performance will almost guarantee you admission</strong>. Scoring a 1410 SAT or a 19 ACT or above will nearly guarantee you admission. Because the school admits 63% of all applicants, being far above average raises the admission rate for you to nearly 100%.</p> \n   <p>If you can achieve a high SAT/ACT score, the rest of your application essentially doesn't matter. You still need to meet the rest of the application requirements, and your GPA shouldn't be too far off from the school average of 2.5. But you won't need dazzling extracurriculars and breathtaking letters of recommendation to get in. You can get in based on the merits of your score alone.</p> \n   <p>But if your score is a 1140 SAT or a 15 ACT and below, you have a good chance of being one of the unlucky few to be rejected.</p>     \n   <br> \n   <div> \n    <img src=\"http://www.prepscholar.com/staticfiles/redesign/images/adm_cta_img.jpg\" alt=\"image description\"> \n    <br> \n    <strong>Want to build the best possible college application?</strong> \n    <div> \n     <p> We can help. <a href=\"https://admissions.prepscholar.com/\"><strong>PrepScholar Admissions</strong></a> is the world's best admissions consulting service.
